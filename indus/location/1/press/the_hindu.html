          <font class="leftnavi" 
      size="2">The redoubtable Hari Prasad Chaurasia cooed eloquence through his flute,   touching both young minds (and there was any number ) and the older in sheer   symphony. Not a note paused fro want of breath from the veteran's flute. The   evening at Viceroy Hotel was dedicated to the elements of air and earth meeting   each other through dance and flute (Uttaraa School of Performing Arts). <br />
          <br />
Little children wielded the bamboo with dexterity while the dais went pulsating   with young footsteps set to classical wizardry in Bharatanatyam. Wedged between   Chaurasia's concert and the dance-song were savvy sportsmen taking centre stage   with their proud parents - V.V.S. Laxman and Mukesh talking of the immense moral   support extended by the sires to shape them into what they are today. <br />
<br />
The colourful evening was a treat from Nalanda Foundation (NF) on   the inaugural of its Indus World School for the academic year 2006. The school   is one of its kind &mdash; doesn't boast of being the `best' in twin cities, nor does   it display a credit rating vis-&agrave;-vis other schools. Put into place (at   Sainikpuri) by a bunch of like-minded intellectuals (IIM and IIT alumni) with a   broad based academic curriculum that is mandatory yet not conventional,   innovative but not bizarre, educative, entertaining and enhancing.<br />
<br />
The primary school is aptly called `Ananda'- a joyous interactive teaching and   learning process with ample scope for an all round growth of the mind and its   creative capacity. Come higher up in the school echelon - the secondary and   higher educative levels - The Ignited Minds are collectively encouraged to   blossom into budding artists, technologists, researchers, sportsmen and what   not. All this means teachers or gurus of phenomenal professional abilities and   extraordinary endurance. Well Indus says it has it. The nitty-gritty of a fee   structure, `recognition,' curriculum, teaching faculty and its special   qualifications could be had at the school premises in case someone is   interested. World class schooling does not necessarily bloom only on foreign   soil. And it does not mean `expensive' education.<br />
<br />
Young, brilliant enthusiasts like Satyanarayanan whose brainchild happens to be   the unique Indus School are to be lauded for their initiative and approach to   experiment with a new form of education which taps potential talent right at   childhood and moulds it into a creditable wholesome personality.<br />
